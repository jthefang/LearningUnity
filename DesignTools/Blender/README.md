## Intro to Viewport UI

- `A` to select all, `Alt + A` to deselect all
- Edit > Preferences > Keymap > Change Select object to Right click (instead of left)
  - "arguably better for your help"
- Top right buttons are tools
  - Gizmo changes camera orientation 
    - Clicking axis orients camera to look along it
    - Click + Drag allows you to rotate the camera around the 3D space
      - Middle click + Drag achieves the same effect
  - Hand icon - change the pivot of the camera (center of camera)
    - Shift + middle mouse drag achieves same thing
- To refocus on selected item
  - Select object > View > Frame Selected
  - Can also use the `.` period key on the numpad to do this
- Camera icon brings you into the view of your camera (for animation)
  - or use 0 on numpad
- Grid icon switches perspective from orthographic (no depth) and perspective (3D) mode

## Layout Workspace Interface Overview

- Bottom bar shows what mouse clicks will do in the current tool context
- Panels
  - top left dropdown to select what the panel displays
  - right click panel > split/join area to create/delete panel
  - `Ctrl + Space` will maximize a panel
- Workspace options to set panel layout in top bar
- `T` for left toolbar
  - `Shift + Space` to bring up the text toolbar (same toolbar but with text instead of icons)
- `N` for right tool bar
  - View bar > 3D cursor 
    - this is spawn point for new objects!
    - Shift + Right click to place the cursor
    - Shift + S > Cursor to World origin to reset cursor to origin
- Pi menus = quick wheel menus 
  - Right click to dismiss menu
  - Press and hold hotkey to initiate Pi menu > Drag cursor to choice and release hotkey
- Timeline panel is below the viewport
  - drag timeline with middle mouse button
- Properties Editor = right panel
  - Top bar = tool options 
  - Camera = rendering options
  - Printer = output options
  - Pictures = layer options
  - Scene tab
  - Globe = world tab
    - background options for the world
  - Next tabs are specific for selected object
    - Object tab
    - Wrench = modifiers tab (modifies the object in layers)
    - Particles tab (create particle systems)
    - Physics tab (physics simulations)
    - Constraints tab (relationships between objects)
      - can copy location, have object look at another (track constraint), have object float above floor (floor constraint)
    - (Green triangle) Mesh tab = shows mesh data
    - Materials tab = how object is shaded
    - Texture tab (checkered canvas)
- Outliner Panel above Properties Editor
- Create scenes in top right
- Create layers in top right
- Can select global light and camera to change light/camera properties

## Select & Transform

- All these are in the quick select tools `T` or `Shift + Space`
- Select Box
  - Ctrl + Drag to deselect
  - `B` for box select tools
    - use middle click drag to deselect objects
  - `C` for circle select (selection brush)
    - middle click drag to deselect objects
  - The most recently select object is brighter yellow and is the one who's properties are displayed
- Top right of viewport > Wire frame mode (Top right bar, leftmost circle)
  - allows you to see through your objects
- Also the Select menu in top bar of viewport
- Right click will cancel the transform
- Holding `Shift` during a transform will reduce the sensitivty of the transform, allowing you to be more precise
- Move tool (cardinal arrows)
  - can move along axis, plane
  - left click drag anywhere in view port to move along viewing port
  - right click will cancel the transform
  - X, Y, Z to move along axis
  - Shift + `X, Y, Z` to scale on plane excluding X, Y, Z respectively
  - `Alt + G` to reset object to origin
- Rotate tool
  - outer white ring rotates the object around the viewing vector
  - inner white sphere lets you left click + drag to free rotation mode
  - `Alt + R` to reset rotation of object
- Scale tool - `S`
  - scale along axis, plane
  - left click drag anywhere in the viewport to scale the whole thing
  - `Alt + S` to reset scale
- Orange dot on object = pivot of object
  - pivot of which all transforms happen
- Red white circle = 3D cursor
  - it can act as the pivot of any object if go to top center dropdown of viewport > Pivot Point > 3D cursor
  - 3D cursor tool (quick select menu)
    - left click and drag to move 3D cursor
    - or `Shift + Right click` to move 3D cursor
    - Click `median point` in pivot to reset to center
  - can also use 3D cursor as where you want object to move to
    - Object menu > Snap > Selection to Cursor
    - `Shift + S` gives snap options Pi menu
- Change coordinate system of object from Global > Local in top center viewport menu
- Snap menu in top center
  - Magnet + the dropdown next to it allow you to snap objects to the grid

## Adding and Deleting Objects

- `Shift + A` for Add menu
  - or Add menu in top of viewport
- Select object > Object > Delete
  - Or `X` to delete with confirmation or `Delete` key
- Go to `Edit mode` (top left dropdown of viewport)
  - allows you to edit the geometry of the object you have selected
  - a lot of different delete options here, see [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSAobQPRLwc&list=PLa1F2ddGya_-UvuAqHAksYnB0qL9yWDO6&index=5&ab_channel=Blender)
    - Edge loop will delete the geometry down to the next edge loop
